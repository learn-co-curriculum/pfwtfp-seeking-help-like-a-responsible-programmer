# Seeking Help like a Responsible Programmer

## Learning Goals

- Identify help request patterns of development

## Introduction

Many developers have written posts to Stack Overflow dozens of times, but only
submitted a few. The reason is because by the time they ask a Good Question,
methodically, they usually find their flaws. We took a look at how to ask
questions in the previous lesson's video. Now we'll retiterate the process we
outlined there and go deeper on each of the individual steps.

### Identify help request patterns of development

Standard Template for Questions:

- A reduced section of code (donâ€™t post the whole thing)
- State your inputs (cut down for size, if necessary)
- State your outputs
- State your expectation
- State your theory for what should have happened
- Check the docs to make sure your implementation works like you think it did
- Test the implementation in IRB
- If necessary at this point, submit the question.

## Conclusion

Generally: methodical description and documentation will help you see your bug.
